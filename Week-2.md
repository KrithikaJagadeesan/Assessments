# Week 2 Assessment

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?
.map() and .filter() both return new arrays that do not change the original array. .map() will return an array with the same number of items as the original array, but not necessarily the same exact items. While .filter(), will produce an array that is smaller than the original array.

2. Why would you use object destructuring?
To easily access properties from objects using variables.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Const variable can not be reassigned, while a let and var variables can. let variables are block scoped, and hence specify a scope, while var variables are hoisted and are functioned scoped, or limited to the function it is defined in.

4. Why is testing important?
Testing is important to see if the block of code is functional for all cases. If there are any errors in the code, by testing they can be fixed efficiently and this improves efficiency for work flow.

5. What is a higher order function?
A higher order function is a function that takes in another function as an argument or a function that returns a function as a result.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?
There are no classes in JS there, instead there are functions that behave as constructors. In javascript everything is an object except for the primative data types.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.
We did not have a group project this past week, but I realized how challenging React was and how i needed to spend more time on it, to be able to understand it better.

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?
You would link a CSS file or stylesheet to the HTML page by putting a <link> tag with the stylesheet info(local url) in the head of the HTML doc(within the <head> tags)

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?
A div and span are both generic containers. A div is a block level container while a span is an in line container.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?
A CSS class is when several elements are given the same styling attributes. An id is used for styling only a single element specifically.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.
head, body, h1, footer

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?
You can set a viewport, or use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, or setting the width or picture to a percentage like 100% rather than a specific width and height.


### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?
Front end development (client side development) has to do with how websites look and how they are structured, it is how design is implemented on the web. HTMl, CSS and Javascript, and Javascript libraries and frameworks(jQuery, React, Angular, etc.) are tools that front-end developers should know well.

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?
When a variable is declared using let inside a function, it can be used only within that function or block of code and not outside.  

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?
It is where the child component receives all of the properties of the parent components and the other ancestor components.
