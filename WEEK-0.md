#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a reusable block of code in JS that takes in a value and returns a result. If you want the same changes to happen to many values then you would pass all of
them through the same function, this is efficient and limits redundant code.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

We would use it for only for debugging to see if our code is working or broken, since it does not effect other code in our document. While return passes value (like from a function) from one scope to another, and this value can't be seen in the terminal unless it is stored in a variable, and console.log(variable). We use return to get value and use that value in our program.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
